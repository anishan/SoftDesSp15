To experiment with the evolve_text program, the program was run with varying values for the population size and the number of generations over which the program runs. The distance from the desired string was used to compare the values as a measure of fitness. First, the number of generations was held constant at 500 generations, and the population size was varied between 1 and 400. For each value, the corresponding highest fitness (least distance) was plotted against the number of individuals in the population. The results can be seen in the file effect_of_pop_size.png file.

The number of generations was also varied, this time from 10 to 600. The least distance was plotted in the file effect_of_num_gen.py. For both these parameters, as the population size and the number of generations increases, the distance away from the desired string decreases (and thus the fitness increases). This makes sense because the fitness increases as the number of mutations increases, and both these parameters increase the number of possible mutations.
